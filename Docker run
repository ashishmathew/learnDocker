docker run redis:4.0  (you can specify version with : - this is called a tag)

using docker in an interactive mode : 
docker run -i app-name (i is used for an interactive mode)

to attach to the containers terminal 
docker run -it app-name

PORT - mapping
- Server where docker is installed is called the Docker Host
- container within a host will have an IP and port 
- Docker host will have an IP and a port
- User cannot hit the internal ip of the container from the web-browser
- so while running the container use the below
  - docker run -p <docket host port - 80> : <container host : 3306> app-name
- You cannot map to the same port on the docker host more than once

Volume mapping : 
  - to map the data to the docker host (so that the data is still persisted even after the container is lost)
  - docker run -v <docker host file path: container file path> app-name

Inspect a container: 
  - docker inspect containername

Container logs : 
  - docker logs containerid
